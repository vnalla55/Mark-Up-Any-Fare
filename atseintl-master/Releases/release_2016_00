Title: [CORE-42] Fix SYSTEM_EXCEPTION in GSA and FL
Date: 11/05/2015
Description:
        The reason for the exception was the following scenario:
            1. In FarePathBuilder duplicating GSA clones preserved travel
               segments, i.e. GSA cloned FarePath for similar itin kept
               pointers to mother's travel segments
            2. In taxes one of the cloned became main fare path for similar
               itin
            3. Fare Calc was not able to find pointed TravelSegs in similar
               itins vector of TravelSegs<br>
            The fix is to create adjusted GSA clones for similar itins<br>

Title: [O&D] Generate message with leg info and display it in the Pricing response
Date: 11/09/2015
Description:
        Pricing will return message with information about legs used in brand retrieval. This may be useful if user doesn't provide leg info himself and Pricing computes it on its own. In this case user will know how Pricing retrieved brands and if it doesn't satisfy its needs he can send another request, this time providing leg info himself.

        [X] all agencies
        [X] all airlines
        [ ] Abacus
        [ ] Axess
        [ ] LAN
        [ ] Other: 
Activated by/Configuration change:
        active in Price by Brand in AS path
Resolution/QA recommendation:
        Verify that leg info displayed in Pricing Response matches legs computed and used in brand retrieval. If legs are provided in the Pricing request (providing that that code change has also been delivered) then leg info in the response should reflect that.

Title: [TECH INITIATIVE] Common/Thread clean-up (phase 2)
Date: 11/10/2015
Description:
        [TECH INITIATIVE] Remove old executor usage (v3).
        v2: Fix the undefined behaviour when the task is destroyed before the executor. The fix has been done in many places throughout the code.
         v3: Add a fallback that guards the synchronous task exception eating behavior change.
        [TECH INITIATIVE] Remove invokeForEachUsesDataHandle.
        It was unset/set to false for about ever.

Activated by/Configuration change:
        Part of the change is guarded by fixed fallback DONT_EAT_SYNC_TASK_EXCEPTIONS
Resolution/QA recommendation:
        No impact in general.
        Some transactions might now fail with an exception, but they were buggy to begin with. To test that, use the fallback.

Title: [Baggage] Reduce baggage validation arguments.
Date: 11/13/2015
Description:
        Simple refactoring to reduce number of arguments for baggage validators.
Applies to: 
        [X] all agencies
        [X] all airlines
        [ ] Abacus
        [ ] Axess
        [ ] LAN
        [ ] Other: 
Activated by/Configuration change:
        BAG_VALIDATION_INTERFACE - dynamic fallback
Resolution/QA recommendation:
        Regression testing. It may (but shouldn't) impact baggage defer processing (among others).

Title: [APO-42256] Fix RTW CAT4 between X and X
Date: 11/13/2015
Description:
        We were incorrectly processing CAT4 and due to that we incorrectly passed CAT9 qualified by CAT4. There was an assumption in our code that if we match segments BETWEEN X and Y and X = Y than we should really match segments WITHIN X location. It may be a good heuristic in case of non-RTW transactions but in case of RTW it doesn't make sense so I changed this condition for RTW.
Applies to: 
        [X] all agencies
        [X] all airlines
        [ ] Abacus
        [ ] Axess
        [ ] LAN
        [ ] Other: 
Activated by/Configuration change:
        <code>RTW_CAT4_BETWEEN - dynamic fallback</code>
Resolution/QA recommendation:
        Only RTW transactions are affected.

Title: [CommissionManagement] SC-45 -Match Points of Sale in Commission Program
Date: 11/16/2015
Description:
        As a Pricing developer, create a function to match Points of Sale in Commission Program.<br>
        Draft FRD:
        for MVP match to actual geographic POS only, not directed POS - agent in YVR but WPSLON - if table says LON fail - requirement in FRD.<br>
        The data is POINTOFSALEITEMNO field in COMMISSIONPROGRAM table which points to COMMISSIONLOC / COMMISSIONLOCSEG tables.<br>
        From DBAccess/CommissionProgramInfo.h
          std::vector<CommissionLocSegInfo*>& pointOfSale() { return _pointOfSale; }   const std::vector<CommissionLocSegInfo*>& pointOfSale() const { return _pointOfSale; }<br>
        Example of COS data:
        US, CA, MX
        EUR,MDE,AFR<br>
        Expected data from our content:
        LOCTYPE
        LOC
        INCLEXCLIND<br>
        Expected data from our DAO:
        class CommissionProgramInfo
          std::vector<CommissionLocSegInfo*> _pointOfSale;
        class CommissionLocSegInfo
          LocKey _loc;   Indicator _inclExclInd;<br>
        Implementation:
        Match LocKey from CommissionLocSegInfo to LocKey of Agency PCC (_trx.getRequest()->ticketingAgent()->tvlAgencyPCC()).
        Once match, check _inclExclInd. If match include, continue to macth next field. If match exclude, move to next Program Rule.

Title: [SFR] FareBasisCode with and without TktDesignator recognition fix
Date: 11/20/2015
Description:
        Before we were matching just the beginning of FBC in PaxTypeFare's, so
        if we gave a fare like "Y", it would match "Y", "Y/*", "YASDQ", "Y*".<br>
        Now we only match fares that are explicitly "Y" or that are of form
        "Y/*" and we do the same logic for baseFare of FBR's.

Title: Fix NoPNRPricing buffer overflow.
Date: 11/25/2015
Description:
        The buffer overflow happened while accessing fare type group status
         stored in fare markets for SPECIAL fare type groups.
         It caused discrepancies in NoPNRPricing response between ATSE compiled
         with old and new compiler settings (GCC5.2 + CPP14)
        This change should make both versions consistent. That is, special fares should be returned from both.

Title: ATPCO_TAXES_ON_ITIN_ENABLED set to Y
Date: 12/03/2015
Description:
        This release note is only notice that I have made changes in ACMS: the TAX_SVC\ATPCO_TAXES_ON_ITIN_ENABLED flag is now set to "Y", because in R00 release this flag is only part of ATPCO on Itinerary activation.
        The second part is entry in Customer Activation Control which is not added for now, so at this moment this ACMS update will not change anything.
        Flag activation was performed for every environment except PROD.
        Source code has not been updated.

Title: [ATPCO Tax] Fix core for AirTaxRQ pricing OC

Activated by/Configuration change:
        Fix only applies when ATPCO_TAXES_ON_ITIN_ENABLED = Y. By default it is 'N' so no change in work is expected.
        In R0 and later releases, even with above settings ATPCO Taxes won't activate without appropriate entry in Customer Activation Table.
