        Internal FallBack control : FALLBACK_MIPOPT_R12_TEST is used to turn on/off this change.<br>
        There is plan that fallback control will be removed after negative tests pased. The new codes will still be active ONLY when transaction is FLM, which is not in PROD yet.
Resolution/QA recommendation:
Entry/XML to recreate:
        The expect impact is only on performance, with soak test.

Title: Fixup diagnostic indeterminism
Date: 10/18/2012
Description:
        Fixup diagnostic indeterminism in Pricing
        <span/>
        Add two optional diagnostic arguments to fixup indeterminism in Pricing
        diagnostics, that exists due to multithreading (for example, in diag 910).
        <span/>
        - NORM_DIAG is to make diag output deterministic
        - NO_METRICS is to cut off metrics at the end of diagnistic
        <span/>
        Adding unit tests:
        - Common/test/TseCallableTrxTask_SequenceIDTest.cpp
        - Diagnostic/test/DiagnosticsTest.C has been fixed up into
          DiagnosticTest.cpp, also adding more unit tests onto
        <span/>
        The result of those two diag params is stable diag byte-to-byte output,
        which is not changing for the same request.

Title: Update PricingUnit's per itin total NUC Amount processing for mipopt
Date: 10/20/2012
Description:
        PricingUnit per itin total is now set to the smallest amount of the per itin total NUC amount.<br>
        Also get and set functions are renamed to make future changes easier.
Applies to:
        [X] all agencies
        [X] all airlines
        [ ] Abacus
        [ ] Axess
        [ ] LAN
        [ ] Other: 
Activated by/Configuration change:
        N/A
Resolution/QA recommendation:
        This delivery itself does not fix any known bugs. We need to have a mipopt request that will generate different plusup amounts (and so totalNUCAmount) for different itins of the same PricingUnit.<br>
        A regression testing is needed since so many files are updated.

Title: MIP Optimization - Fixed itin data sharing
Date: 10/25/2012
Description:
        Those fix a bug that was introduced with itin-data sharing. 
        When cloning a PaxTypeFare / Fare to a duplicate fareMarkets in FCO, it is possible that the 
        duplicate FM relates to a different set of itins than the original FM. 
        Such missing itin-data was added, but now ptfItinData stores pointers instead of values, 
        so the previous shallow copy caused that we ended up with PaxTypeFares from different 
        FMs sharing same itin-data which caused core when running in multiple threads.
