README / USAGE
~------------~

1. It is strongly recommended to get familiar with "git help bisect".

2. Copy this directory manually to be under build directory root or $HOME,
   just to be not affected via git bisect itself.

3. hammer_test_example.sh must be renamed into hammer_test.sh and
   adjusted to test tseserver against your "bad" request example.

4. You might want to adjust commit_check.cfg
   to setup different host and port for tseserver.

5. git bisect is recommended to be run from clean build directory,
   although it is not a strict rule.

6. Run git_bisect/commit_check.sh solely to make sure commit_check.cfg
   is set up OK and HEAD commit will be reported as "bad".

7. How to run it from build directory root

    $ git bisect start <bad> <good>
    $ git bisect run git_bisect/commit_check.sh


LIMITATION

For now git bisect has nothing to do with discrepancies, that are caused by
ACMS changes. Thus, first make sure you are trying you locate an error or a discrepancy,
which is caused by code change only.
